# Project Status: WebSocket Server with End-to-End Encryption

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Features Implemented
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Hybrid encryption using AES-256-GCM + X25519
- **Selective Encryption**: Direct messages encrypted, broadcasts remain public
- **Transparent Operation**: Encryption/decryption handled automatically by SDK
- **Docker Support**: Full Docker Compose setup with multiple test clients
- **Zero-Knowledge Server**: Server cannot decrypt private messages

└── main.go         # Server entry point
```

### Security Properties
- ✅ Messages encrypted end-to-end between clients
- ✅ Server acts as blind relay for encrypted messages
- ✅ Each message uses unique AES key
- ✅ X25519 keys stored securely in database
- ✅ Forward secrecy through ephemeral keys in box seal

### Testing Verified
- Direct messages between Alice and Bob are encrypted
- Server sees only encrypted gibberish for private messages
- Broadcasts remain plaintext as intended
- Docker containers work with full encryption support

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose up --build

# Clients will automatically connect and announce presence
# Direct messages between clients are automatically encrypted
# Broadcasts remain public
```
